## Automate Password Expiry Reminders in Just a Few Clicks with AdminDroid
Power Automate flows can be tricky and limited. The Password Expiry Reminder Agent, integrated with the [AdminDroid Microsoft administration 365 tool](https://admindroid.com/?src=GitHub) covers what they miss, with less effort! Unlike flows, you can customize follow-up intervals without juggling complex steps. You can also notify admins at the right time when users haven’t taken action.

Plus, you can:

- Apply filters to target specific users
- Notify designated admins along with end users
- Send alerts via email or Microsoft Teams
- Deploy it all in just a few clicks
